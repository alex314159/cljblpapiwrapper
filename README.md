# cljblpapiwrapper

Simple Clojure wrapper around the Bloomberg Java API

## Usage

This will only work if you're connected to Bloomberg, typically on a machine where the Bloomberg terminal application is running. The request/response paradigm and the subscription paradigm are currently implemented. Please check the examples.

Breaking change from 0.3.3 to 0.3.5: latest SDK returns dates with timezone so "yyyy-mm-dd+hh:mm" instead of "yyyy-mm-dd" previously.
