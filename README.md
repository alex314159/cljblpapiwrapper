# cljblpapiwrapper

Simple Clojure wrapper around the Bloomberg Java API

## Usage

This will only work if you're connected to Bloomberg, typically on a machine where the Bloomberg terminal application is running, although SAPI connection is also available. The request/response paradigm and the subscription paradigm are currently implemented. Please check the examples.

Breaking change from 0.3.3 to 0.3.5: latest SDK returns dates with timezone so "yyyy-mm-dd+hh:mm" instead of "yyyy-mm-dd" previously.

0.3.6: update to blpapi 3.25.2.1. Many strings replaced by Bloomberg Name classes as former methods deprecated.
